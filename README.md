# AmazonSalesDashboard

This project presents a detailed sales performance analysis of Amazon product data using an interactive Power BI dashboard, with DAX-powered calculations and time intelligence functionalities. The analysis leverages the following datasets:

1. Amazon Sales Dataset – containing product-level details such as name, category, description, date of sale, revenue, and number of reviews.

2. Date Table – a custom date dimension created to enable time-based slicing and aggregation.

The dashboard is fully interactive, featuring slicers for product category and fiscal quarter, and is designed to support both high-level overview and detailed exploratory analysis.
